# Awka FAQ

## Why compile Awk script into C program?

  * C program probably run faster.
  * "AWK programs are limited to what the interpreter provides".
  * "C code can be compiled with other code into a larger application."
  * "migrate stable functions from AWK to C" to impove performance.
  * Reuse existing C functions in Awk script.
  * A way of protect your Awk script.

Actually, the mixing use of Awk and C provide provide an interesting way of writing programs.
